### Recommendations

1. **Address Missing Data**: It is crucial to handle missing values appropriately to ensure robust analysis. Techniques such as imputation or filtering out entries with excessive missing data should be considered.

2. **Focus on Economic Growth**: Countries with lower Life Ladder scores should be targeted for economic development initiatives. Strategies to increase GDP per capita could lead to improved happiness levels.

3. **Enhance Social Support Systems**: Governments and organizations should invest in community-building programs that strengthen social ties, as social support is closely linked to happiness.

4. **Promote Personal Freedom**: Policies that enhance individual freedoms and reduce bureaucratic constraints can help improve overall happiness.
